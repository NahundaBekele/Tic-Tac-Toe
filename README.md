Gameplay
The game follows the standard Tic Tac Toe rules. Two players take turns marking the board with "X" and "O". The first player to achieve a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line of three marks wins. If the board fills up without a winner, it's a draw.

Click on a square on the board to place your mark.
The game will alternate turns between you and the computer opponent (basic AI).
Visual cues will indicate whose turn it is and the current board state.
Functionality
This implementation includes:

Game logic for player turns, win/draw conditions, and basic AI opponent.
Click detection for registering player moves.
(Optional) Visual representation of the game board (implementation details depend on your approach).
Note: This is a basic implementation and can be extended with features like:

Two-player mode (local or network play).
Difficulty levels for the AI opponent.
Score tracking and win/loss statistics.
